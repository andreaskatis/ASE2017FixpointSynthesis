\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:impl}

The implementation of the algorithm has been added to a branch of the  \jkind~\cite{jkind} model checker\footnote{The \jkind fork with \jsynvg is available at \url{https://goo.gl/WxupTe}.}.  \jkind officially supports synthesis
%\grigory{Unofficially? We have the Tech Report, it is all official ;)}
using a $k$-inductive approach, named \jsyn~\cite{KatisFGBGW16}. For clarity, we named
our validity-guided technique \jsynvg (i.e., validity-guided synthesis). \jkind uses Lustre~\cite{lustrev6} as its specification and implementation language.

, which functions as an intermediate representation to the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (\textsc{AADL})~\cite{feiler2006architecture}.
The latter is a high-level specification and analysis language with which
contracts are expressed, using the Assume-Guarantee Reasoning (\textsc{AGREE})
framework~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}.
\andrew{it seems strange to be talking about AADL and maybe even AGREE  at all here.}

into an efficient and practical implementation. To compare the quality of implementations against \jsyn, we use
\smtlibtoc, a tool that has been specifically developed to translate
  Skolem functions to C implementations\footnote{The \smtlibtoc tool is available at \url{https://goo.gl/EvNrAU}.}.

%future work.
