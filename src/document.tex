\section{Validity-Guided Synthesis from Assume-Guarantee Contracts}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
(Text from CAV submission)
We describe a system using the disjoint sets $state$ and $inputs$.
Formally, an \emph{implementation} is a \emph{transition system}
described by an initial state predicate $I(s)$ of type $state \to
bool$ and by a transition relation $T(s,i,s')$ of type $state \to
inputs \to state \to bool$.

An Assume-Guarantee (AG) contract can be formally defined by a set of
\emph{assumptions} and a set of \emph{guarantees}. The
\emph{assumptions}, $A: state \rightarrow inputs \rightarrow bool$,
impose constraints over the inputs which may be modal in terms of the
previous state. The \emph{guarantees} $G$ consist of two separate
subsets $G_I: state \rightarrow bool$ and $G_T: state \rightarrow
inputs \rightarrow state \rightarrow bool$, where $G_I$ defines the
set of valid initial states, and $G_T$ specifies the properties that
need to be met during each new transition between two states. Internally, the transition relation contains an input variable
\textit{init}, which handles which subset of the guarantees the state should
satisfy. As such, if $init = true$, the skolem function provides a transition to
an initial state, where $G_I$ needs to hold. If $init = false$ the new state has
to satisfy $G_T$. Note that we do not necessarily expect that a contract would
be defined over all variables in the transition system, but we do not make any
distinction between internal state variables and outputs in the
formalism. This way, we can use state variables to (in some cases)
simplify specification of guarantees.

\subsection{Approach}

The main idea of the algorithm is to use over- and underapproximations to
find a fixpoint of states, in which the system can safely use
the transition relation without violating the contract. Due to AE-VAL's
machinery, we are able to finally extract a Skolem Function $S_k$ that describes an implementation.

Initially, $F(s, i, s')$ covers pairs of states for which, for any $i$
satisfying the assumptions, $T(s,i,s') \land A(s',i)$ is true. Assuming that the
consistency check passes, i.e. there exist $s, i ,s'$ for which $T(s,i,s') \land
A(s',i)$ is true, we ask AE-VAL whether the formula $\forall s,i,s'. F(s,i,s') \Rightarrow \exists s''.
F(s,i,s'') \land G(s'')$ is valid. States $s$ can be considered as
states in the state space $F$, that do not need to comply with the contract.
Also, notice the difference in using $s'$ and $s''$ in the previous formula. State $s'$ is essentially, a throw-away state, which is only used to
capture the state space of interest. On the other hand, $s''$ is used to find
witness states that satisfy both the transition from $s$, as well as the
contract assumptions and guarantees. If the formula is valid, we can safely
extract a skolem function that always provides a safe transition. This case is
exactly the same with the case where a k-inductive proof is generated using only the inductive step (see ExtendCheck in CAV paper).

Alternatively, AE-VAL will return with a ``non-valid'' answer. In addition to
this, a subset, named $Q(s,i,s')$ is also generated, for which the formula
$\forall s,i. Q(s,i,s') \Rightarrow \exists s''. F(s,i,s'') \land G(s'')$ is
valid. It is important to keep in mind that we do not want to restrict the input
variables any more than the constraints imposed by the assumptions, something
that may happen during the creation of Q(s,i,s'). Nevertheless, we can still use
this subset to refine $F(s,i,s')$, in the following way:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Define $R(s,s') = true$. Examine the validity of $\forall s,s'. R(s,s')
  \Rightarrow \exists i. T(s,i,s') \land \lnot Q(s,i,s')$. If the formula is
  valid, the contract cannot be realizable, as for every state pair $s, s'$,
  there are inputs for which we are essentially moving out of the valid region
  $Q$. On the other hand, if AE-VAL returns ``non-valid'' we receive a valid
  subset of $R(s,s')$, namely $W(s,s')$.
  \item By definition, we now have that $\forall s,s'. W(s,s') \Rightarrow
  \exists i. T(s,i,s') \land \lnot Q(s,i,s')$. The set $W(s,s')$ effectively
  describes a region of states for which the contract is violated, and therefore will have to be blocked from the
  resulting set that describes the system's ``good'' states. Thus, we refine
  $F(s,i,s') \equiv F(s,i,s') \land \lnot W(s,s')$.
  \item We plug the refined $F(s,i,s')$ in the original formula, along with
  $F(s,i,s'')$ for the right hand side of the implication, and reiterate the
  process. Eventually, a fixpoint is reached where we get a valid answer and
  extract a Skolem relation that can always provide safe transitions.
\end{itemize}
