Automated synthesis of reactive systems from specifications has been a topic of research for decades.  Recently, a variety of approaches have been proposed to extend synthesis of reactive systems from propositional specifications towards specifications over rich theories. 
%Such approaches include inductive synthesis, template-based synthesis, counterexample-guided synthesis, and predicate abstraction techniques. In this paper, w
We propose a novel, completely automated approach to program synthesis which reduces the problem to deciding the validity of a set of $\forall\exists$-formulas. 
In spirit of 
%Inspired by verification techniques that construct inductive invariants, like 
IC3 / PDR, our problem space is recursively refined by blocking out regions of unsafe states, aiming to discover a fixpoint that describes safe reactions.
If such a fixpoint is found, we construct a witness that is directly translated into an implementation. 
We implemented the algorithm on top of the \jkind model checker, and exercised it against contracts written using
the Lustre specification language. 
Experimental results show how the new algorithm outperforms 
\jkind's already existing synthesis procedure based on k-induction and addresses soundness issues in the k-inductive approach with respect to unrealizable results.

Automated synthesis of reactive systems using only specification knowledge is one of
the most popular and well explored subjects in formal verification. A variety of
approaches have been proposed in the recent years, through inductive and
functional synthesis, while template-based, counterexample-guided and predicate abstraction techniques
have been proved useful towards extending the applicability of such algorithms
to solving difficult problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
program synthesis, which is based on the validity of a $\forall\exists$-formula.
The approach is inspired from verification techniques that construct
inductive invariants, like Property Directed Reachability, and is completely automated. The original
problem space is recursively refined by blocking out regions of unsafe states, with the goal being the discovery of a
fixpont that describes a region containing safe reactions. If such a fixpoint
is found, we construct a witness that can be directly transformed into an
implementation using mainstream programming languages, like C. We implemented
the algorithm in the \jkind model checker, and exercised it against contracts
written using the Lustre specification language. Experimental results show how
the new algorithm yields better performance as well as soundness for ``unrealizable'' results when compared to \jkind's existing synthesis procedure, an approach that is based on the construction of k-inductive proofs of realizability.
